# Unlocking Nepali Text Comprehension through Machine Translation and LoRA Fine-Tuning of Open-Source LLM

This repository contains the datasets for the project titled "Unlocking Nepali Text Comprehension through Machine Translation and LoRA Fine-Tuning of Open-Source LLM," authored by Kshitiz Rimal at the University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.

## Overview

The repository includes a set of question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs in Nepali romanized style language, along with separate translation pairs for both questions and answers.

## Dataset

The dataset is divided into two parts:
- `nepali_qa_pairs.jsonl`: This file contains Q&A pairs in romanized Nepali.
- `translated_qa_pairs.jsonl`: This file contains the translated pairs of questions and answers, with translations done separately for each.
- `df_simple.csv`: This file contains the inference results of base and finetuned model on evaluation set of simple questions.
- `df_complex.csv`: This file contains the inference results of base and finetuned model on evaluation set of complex questions.
