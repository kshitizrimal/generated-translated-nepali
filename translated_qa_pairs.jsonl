Moreover, the company must be transparent about the reasons for the layoff and future plans. If the layoff is temporary, the company can provide certain benefits for that period. However, if the layoff is permanent, the company must give priority to the employees for re-employment. If you think that you have been unfairly treated during the layoff process, you have the right to take legal action and fight for compensation."}
